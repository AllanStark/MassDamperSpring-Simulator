# Topic: Simulation of a Mass-Damper-Spring Simulator
## Intro

The purpose of this laboratory work is to simulate a damped harmonic simulator. The main problem was to represent mathematically the problem.
In fact we have to deal with a second-order differential equation. To solve this equation I used Euler's method.

When we have our differential equation solved, we can use the obtained data to plot it or to create a simple simulation.

## Coding
The program was written fully in python and I've used the numpy, matplotlib, pygame libraries in order to make things happen.


Here is a little [demo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_v3KKUh3Ks&hd=1)
