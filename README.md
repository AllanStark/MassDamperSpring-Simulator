# Topic: Simulation of a Mass-Damper-Spring Simulator
## Intro

The purpose of this laboratory work is to simulate a damped harmonic simulator. The main problem was to represent mathematically the problem.
In fact we have to deal with a second-order differential equation. To solve this equation I used Euler's method.

When we have our differential equation solved, we can use the obtained data to plot it or to create a simple simulation.

The differential equation used is:

## Prepairing
The process of prepairing for the lab was done in a team of: [Alexandra Ple»ôco](https://github.com/sashokparashok), [Eugen Ungureanu](https://github.com/Requiem-), [Sergiu Terman](https://github.com/xserjjx), [Vladimir Tribusean](https://github.com/vladutzik).
And as you warned us in the lab requirements, we had lot of fun. :smile:


## Coding
The program was written fully in python and I've used the numpy, matplotlib, pygame libraries in order to make things happen.


Here is a little [demo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_v3KKUh3Ks&hd=1)


## Outro
At this laboratory work I had the opportunity to represent mathematically and to simulate a real physical process. The main difficulty was to understand the mathematical problem and to learn how Euler's method works. The rest of the process was fun.
